``CANIDFilter`` --- CAN ID acceptance filter
============================================

.. py:class:: CANIDFilter([mask=None])

    Represents a CAN ID filter to select which incoming frames match.

    :param str mask: The filter mask string describing the ID to match, or `None` to match all 11- and 29-bit identifiers

    :raises ValueError: if the length of the `mask` string is not 11 or 29 characters long or contains characters other than 'X', '1' or '0'
    :raises TypeError: if `mask` is not of type `str`

    The `mask` is a binary character string that defines the ID matching to take place. It is composed of only ``X``, ``1`` or ``0``
    and must be 11 or 29 characters long. A ``X`` character means "don't care", a ``1`` means "Must be 1" and ``0`` means "Must be 0".


Examples
--------

The following gives an ID filter that accepts all CAN frames::

    CANIDFilter()

To accept all frames with 11-bit identifiers::

    CANIDFilter(mask='XXXXXXXXXXX')


To accept all CANOpen 'Transmit SDO' frames::

    CANIDFilter(mask='1101XXXXXXX')
